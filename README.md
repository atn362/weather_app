The weather app project was a very challenging and interesting at the same time.  Like most projects utilizing JavaScript, I had to rely on the assistance of my tutor to some degree.  That being said, it was still fun and I certainly learned a lot while doing so.  It was interesting and challenging working and linking an API to my code.  Lots of hair pulling at times, but realizing how much real time data is passed through the API to my application was astounding.  Not having to rely on moment.js for the current date really cut back on the amount of coding  I actually had to do.  The trickiest part of working with the API was trying to find one that was not free, but also still functioning and allowing new subscribers to apply.  Also having to rely solely on pure CSS for the styling was interesting. I've used Bootstrap primarily for the last few projects, so brushing up on those was beneficial for keeping them relevant in my mind.
